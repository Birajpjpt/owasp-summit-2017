title   : Hands on Threat Modeling Juice Shop (Architecture)
---


## Outcomes

### Synopsis and Takeaways

The Session was very productive. A live copy of Juice shop was demonstrated to the room and shared via Google Hangouts, from which valuable input was given. Insight to how Juice shop functions was exhibited from code on the local server. During this demo, as a group, a model was created of the Juice Shop application in real-time.
Architecture diagrams from the session were compared to the current official architecture that contrasted differences of opinion. These diagrams spanned information from the browser, server, and file system. Injection processes that function with Juice shop were discussed. 
 
The group moved from the question of “what is Juice Shop?” to “what can go wrong with Juice Shop?”.  It was decided that the first session would be a bigger group session to bring everyone up to speed, with the later sessions being smaller dedicated teams. 

**Outcomes** 

- Demonstrated that professionals can work from different points of view on this core topic 
- Decided that a threat model diagram can be created on Juice Shop in great detail
- A useful architecture mapping diagram was created.
