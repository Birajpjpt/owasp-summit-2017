### Synopsis and Takeaways

This session discussed the current and in development features of Juice Shop. The focus was on an in development feature, called Two-Factor-Authentication. Ideally using TOTP technology (One time password) in the authentication process. A diagram was created on this. An additional sequence diagram was created on how data interacts with a user in Two-Factor-Authentication.

Other features such as Invoice tracking, delivery and email services are also discussed. Potential publishing a cheat sheet of does and don’ts when using Data flow modelling.

### Outcomes
- Created a sequence diagram of Two-Factor-Authentication information.
- Created a data flow diagram on new and improved features for Juice Shop.
- The architectural possibilities highlighted in the discussion allow new features to be added.
- A Cheat Sheet of does and don’ts when using Data flow modelling to be created.
- “Juice Shop left overs” (product) to be picked up by a 3rd party for recycling and compost.
- To create a feature for Invoice tracking, for the accounting team using a separate UI dialog, in juice shop that will use XML or CSV files.
- A diagram that could be extended into a fully reusable threat model. This will become the final published product.
