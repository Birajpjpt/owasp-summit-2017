- Evidence-based business case, but not constructive fear-mongering
- Security function needs to provide value
- Case study mentioned: change the culture of security - to become the most secure organisation - run exercises 
to identify potential security champions - trained in security and peer-2-peer working ("influencers") - colleagues 
want to become like this and the effect snowballs - approach originally developed by ETNA
- Goal of security team is to close the gap between security and development
- WAF?  operational or AppSec?
- Ultimate goal of security is to reduce risk
- Required skills: coding, infosec, risk, social
- Universities are teaching GCHQ type security course, not AppSec
- Hardest skill is development - AppSec is not for graduates
- Source AppSec team from within development community
- Secure code is an output of great developers
- Security champion is a developer who can teach, role model, culture changer, and trained in security, give them a career roadmap
- Install "love" for security from young age (8-13) 
- Kids see hacking as how to break things - we have to tell them it's about building things properly;  
hacking is part of the journey - but it needs to be fun
