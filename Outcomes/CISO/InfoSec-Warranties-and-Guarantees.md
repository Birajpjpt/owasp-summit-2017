## Outcomes

This Working Session will try to answer the question whether security companies should issue guarantees and warranties and provide a set of guidelines on how they should be designed and implemented.

### Synopsis and Takeaways

Decisions on purchasing security products with Cyber Insurance should not be based solely on the warranty (no matter how good it seems). Some Warranties may only cover secondary insurance that can cost the policyholder thousands if not millions.

Reliance on warranties requires scrutiny, equivalent to buying cyberinsurance; however, warranties could be seen as a marketing ploy. It is normally not worth investigating a warranty for a product when the cost of the investigation is weighed against the cost of the initial cover. Normally negotiating warranty contracts can achieve more favourable terms. Collecting information on companies that have submitted claims and the results of the claims process would prove useful.

### Warranties should include:

- Provide data to backup marketing claims
- Independently validated data
- Monetary value at least equivalent to what was paid at the point of deployment.
- Refunds, not credit for more services from the same vender
- Should not be conditional based on incident response or other internal procedures
- Include the right to breach the contract (Termination Clause)

You cannot make decisions based purely on warranty claims.

### Takeaways

Provided marketing data to support claims
Collecting information about companies that submitted claims and the results of that process would prove useful.
Warranties that provide something that the policy holder has complete control over such as:
- Uptime
- Direct performance indicators
