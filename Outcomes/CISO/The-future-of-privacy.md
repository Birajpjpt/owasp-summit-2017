## Outcomes

- OWASP Privacy statements
- Concept of a campaign and compliance of OWASP community and foundation, road map

### Synopsis and Takeaways

"Is there a future for privacy?"

Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1791: "There is no freedom without security"

**GENERAL**

- Privacy is not a legal question! Privacy is a matter for individuals, not the courts!

- Privacy is not question of compliance (of companies, organisations, etc.)!

- Privacy is not a question of identifiability: we assume here that you ARE identifiable!

- Review resources: are there resources for privacy which

	- list types of privacy items

	- deliver categories of privacy

**Risks**

- Types of privacy / personal data (brain storming)

  - including criticality (high | medium |low | none)

	- Name
	- Gender
	- Address
	- Email address
	- Phone numbers
	- Photos/Videos of person
	- Date of birth
	- Place of birth
	- Name of schools / universities / employers
	- Job-position
	- Salary
	- Property
	- Passport data
	- Biometric data, e.g. thumbprint
	- Social security number / health insurance ID
	- IP-address
	- Cookies
	- Credit-card numbers
	- Bank account numbers
	- Health data
	- DNA profile
	- Live style data / tracking
        - Location data / movement profiles
	- Consumer data
	- Digital signatures
	- Digitally stored manual signatures (e.g. signature pads)
	- Criminal records
	- Political, religious, or philosophical beliefs

**Categories of privacy / personal data (brain storming)**

   Main categories:
     - Personal identifiable information (PII)
     - Sensitive personal information (SPI) [context dependent]

  **Sub categories:**

     - Legally relevant data
     - Insurance relevant data
     - Socially relevant data
     - Financial data

**Controls and Measures (Web-Apps)**

- Browser technology: what should be improved (not: what is technical possible and not what vendors like to do)
- Rules for apps: privacy by design
- Automated information to individuals, not on request (e.g. once a year etc.)

**Future Trends**

- Are there technical solutions conceivable, which help individuals to collect?

      - Who has which type of personal data stored?
      - Where is it stored?

- This concerns "white hats": companies, organisations, and governments who have stored data.

- The "black hats" (criminal individuals or gangs) are not our focus here.
