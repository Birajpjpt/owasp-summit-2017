## Outcomes

The Application Security Guide for CISO 2013 Version Goals were:
1. Make Application Security and OWASP More Visible to Application Security Managers & CISOs
2. Analyse Reasons for Adopting An Application Security Program by An Organisation (e.g. Tactical and Strategic)
3. Explain Difference Between Technical Risks and Business Risks including How to Estimate Costs of Data Breaches
4. Factor The impact of Emerging Technologies in Application Security Program (e.g. Mobile, Cloud, Web Services) and provide guidance
5. Provide Examples of Metrics & Measurements for Vulnerability Risk Management

For The Planned 2018 Version, Which Problems and Solutions/Guidance We Can Expand Upon ? (NOTE These Will be Assessed With Expanded CISO Survey Questions):
1. Impact of GDPR on AppSec and Recommendations (Including Outcomes of 2017 Summit CISO track)
2. Emerging technology risks and Risk Mitigation Guidance (e.g. APIs and Micro-services, Biometrics)
3. Evolving Threats Facing Web Applications (e.g. 0-day exploits of AppSec vulnerabilities) and solutions (e.g. improved attack detection with new tools such as Outcome 1 (unranked) – What topics would you like covered in the new CISO guide? as RASP)
4. Others (brainstorming)

### Synopsis and Takeaways

**Outcome 1 – What topics would you like covered in the new CISO guide? (unranked)**

- Incorporate reference to outcomes of 2017 Summit CISO track
- Expand to include new tools/technologies
- Expand to include compliance with GDPR
- Expand on new emerging technology risks and provide risk Mitigation Guidance (e.g. APIs, proliferation, and Micro-services/interoperability, Biometrics, Cloud (internal and external), strategies for managing risk in Cloud environments)
- Expand on Risk Management Strategies for Vendors, Provisioning, Supply-Chain Risks
- Expand on new evolving threats facing web Applications (e.g. 0-day exploits
- Add reference to handbooks and  playbooks for CISO’s managed process
- Where to provide guidance or where to put a focus, e.g., 5,000 applications in different countries, where to allocate security resources in such a situation
- How to get visibility across the organisation – who is doing what.  As CISO you need to know what changes are being made, and where
- Corporate culture:  how can a CISO be an agent of change and overcome cultural challenges?  Knowing the corporate culture to enable CISO to function properly; trust is crucial to success
- Success stories as examples of how to win – people can refer to these as a value-add – how can the CISO provide value to the business
- Knowing the right questions to ask triggers the appropriate response and action
- A proactive, strategic CISO is better than a reactive one:  knowing to shift focus from fighting fires to ensuring the fires do not get out of control
- After an incident, think about how to promote change; train people to think holistically not just about the incident, but about the impact of the incident
- Involvement CISO should be involved in road mapping for future deployment and included in business development meeting so CISO can plan ahead
- Format:  It was agreed that a handbook would have more value than a playbook given threat variables between company requirements

**Outcome 2 – What type of question would you like included in the new CISO guide? (unranked)**

- Which among the organization IT assets, networks or applications are considered more at risk of cyber-attacks ?
- Does your organization have a cyber-threat intelligence program and attack monitoring/alert process ?
- Does your organization has adopted S-SDLC? If yes which one. Does it include threat modeling ?
- Is application security seen as an investment or as a cost by your organization ?
- Does your planning of application security follow a long term strategy  (at least two years)  ?
- Need to ask questions about how to map the scope, application, and business process perspectives
- How to manage risk from third parties, private vs. public premise
- How do you manage the risk for developing technologies, such as the Cloud?

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Information security professionals who are responsible for managing and delivering application security programs, including security in the SDLC (S-SDLC)
- Information security officers in senior management roles, including technology managers/directors responsible for managing software and application security
