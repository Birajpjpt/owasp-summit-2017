## Outcomes
Create common datasets with the purpose of testing and validating of machine learning algorithms security
- we can use data output of Mod Security, webgoat and others to create the datasets
- those datasets should be shared
- anonymized dataset
- common dataset for testing

Create guidance page to include ML security definitions, latest reports and links to the available tools and datasets.
- find good materials and resources

Use ML techniques in the current tools provided by OWASP (e.g. use ML to reduce false positives in ZAP scanning output)

Create working group to work on tools and guidance of:
- how can we check if a dataset is
 noise free (not compromised)
- review of algorithms implementations
