# Best Practices

## Timebox your exercises

When giving students a (hacking) exercise make sure they know how much
time they have for it. At the end of the timebox show the solution to
the exercise live on the video projector so everyone sees it at least
once.

## Explain Actual Risks

Security issues cannot be considered in isolation so you need to be able
to measure their value/risk over e.g. functional changes or other
requirements. Developers need to learn how to balance all these
requirements appropriately.

## Include Corporate Coding Standards

Use code examples from or aligned with the _company's (secure) coding
standards_ to show insecure code and how to fix it during a developer
training.

##  Have an Icebreaker

Have a gimmick - something novel for the participants - e.g breaking a
physical safe or picking a lock.

## Learn the whole Lifecycle

Sandbox examples, discover the vulnerability, use the exploit to gain
access and then issue a fix - learn the whole lifecycle

## Red Team + Blue Team = Purple Team

Make sure Attacker _and_ Defender perspective is covered, e.g. don't
focus your trainings just on fixing vulnerabilities.

## Provide Context

Give an overview of the training/exercise application used so the
students have sufficient background for their own attack attempts.

## Internal Security MeetUp

Use a format similar to after-work [MeetUp](https://meetup.com) where a
mentor (e.g. Security Champion) goes through one topic per session. A
monthly schedule should be maintained to keep up the community-aspect of
this format.
