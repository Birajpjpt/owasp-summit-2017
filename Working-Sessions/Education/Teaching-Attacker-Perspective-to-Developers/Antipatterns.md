# Antipatterns

## ZAP'n'Burp

Try to teach how to use non-trivial tools like OWASP ZAP or BurpSuite
_along the way_ during a beginner's level web security training.

## Time Cheater

Go overtime with your _frontal lecture_ part and try to make up for it
by a) skipping or b) cutting the far more interesting _exercises and
demos_.

## Toy Overkill

Overwhelm students with a myriad of different pentesting & hacking tools
during a developer training. Worst case: Let them use _Kali Linux_ right
from the start.

## Elongated Code Reviews

Going through an extensive code snippet line by line by line by ...
Zzzzzz...

## Wrong Tech Stack

Focus too much on vulnerabilities that are not relevant for the
techology stack used by the developers in your training.

## Mandatory Training

Force _every developer_ into a generic security training even though it
might not affect them in their daily work.
