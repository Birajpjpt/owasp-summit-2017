SAMM core model update sessions.

## Why

This Working Session will look at the core model to see what updates related to automation, cloud, etc. could or should align with how things are done today.

## What

- Review implementation guidance related to automation
- Review guidance based on cloud solutions

## Outcomes

- Core Model

### Symopsis and Takeaways

- We are exploring adding a fifth business function to the SAMM Model.
- This function will be somewhere between the current "Construction" and "Verification" Business Functions
- This new function may encompass code building and code mangement
- The current "Construction" Business Function is mostly about design, so it needs recategorizing
- Defect management is not clearly defined in the current SAMM Model
- Fundamental additions and changes to the current SAMM Model will most likely need to be made
- Ideas for the new Business Function naming and criteria have been put forward
- Ideas for new Security Practises have been noted
- Likely updates to the "Operations"Business Function are to be made to account for more infrastructure related activities

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

- Security champions
- Security architects
- DevOps Roles
- CISOs
