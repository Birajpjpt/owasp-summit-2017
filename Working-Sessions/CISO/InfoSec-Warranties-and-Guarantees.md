99.9% of current InfoSec vendors do not offer any warranties or guarantees. Although offering them presents a unique opportunity for them to differentiate themselves from competitors, they simply do not want the liability.

## Why

In the absence of warranties and guarantees, customers are facing the following challenges:
- Lack of guarantees makes it difficult to differentiate effective solutions from those that are less effective.
- No warranties or guarantees makes it impossible to justify the cost of InfoSec products to management.
- Without guarantees or warranties, customers find it hard to trust their InfoSec vendors since they are not accountable for the performance of their products.

This Working Session will examine the need for InfoSec warranties and guarantees, and how they might be designed and implemented.


## What

 - Are warranties and guarantees in InfoSec inevitable?
 - How to make warranties and guarantees work
 - What should be covered?
 - Should governments have a role in (for example) providing 'Cyber Insurance' for 'well-behaved companies'?
 - The roles of labels and market forces
 - Are we in a 'market for lemons'?
 - The role of Government Agencies
 - What lessons can be learned from the Food and Public Safety agencies (and activities)?
 
## Outcomes

This Working Session will try to answer the question whether security companies should issue guarantees and warranties and provide a set of guidelines on how they should be designed and implemented.

## Who

The target audience for this Working Session is:

 - Buyers of InfoSec products and services
 - InfoSec Products and Services providers
 - Government Agencies
