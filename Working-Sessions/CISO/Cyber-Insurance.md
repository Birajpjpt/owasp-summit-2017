According to industry veteran and Chief of Security Strategy at SentinelOne, Jeremiah Grossman, the security industry must change. Today, security industry is one of the only businesses that does not offer any guarantees or warranties.
As a result, almost a third of all U.S companies have some kind of a cyber insurance coverage and PwC estimates that the market for cyber insurance will grow to $7.5 billion by 2020.

## Why

According to Grossman, companies spend $3.8 billion annually on traditional security equipment like AV, firewalls and intrusion detection, but they also spend $3.2 billion on cyber insurance.
This means that a lot of companies opt to spend their money on insurance when they get hit with a breach. But looking at the numbers from some of the biggest incidents, we can conclude that companies are not buying enough cyber insurance:
- Target breach cost the retailer $248 million, but the insurance company only paid out $90 million.
- Home Depot lost $43 million on its breach, with an insurance payout of about $15 million.
-  Anthem, which experienced a major breach in 02/2015, now has a policy in excess of $150 million,

This Working Session will focus on how well the cyber insurance market is working, and how cost-effective it is.
